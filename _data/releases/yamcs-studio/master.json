    "body": "* New\r\n  * The looks of the Event Log can be changed using custom rules\r\n  * An OPI file can be marked as the active 'schema'. Properties of this schema's widgets become defaults while editing other displays.\r\n  * Named OPI fonts/colors are now stored to user preferences. The initial list of named colors is less opinionated. Liberation Sans is the new default font.\r\n  * Yamcs Studio no longer auto-creates an example project. Instead examples can be manually added to your workspace via `File > New > Example...`\r\n  * Replay options have been extended to support range limiting, step-by-step replay and arbitrary speed factors.\r\n  * Application logs are now automatically persisted to `~/.config/yamcs-studio/logs` (rotated)\r\n  * Column changes in Command History and Event Log are saved to user preferences.\r\n  * When opening Yamcs Studio, the last used workspace is reopened.\r\n  * The Links view now indicates IN and OUT data counters in different columns, as introduced in Yamcs v4.7.\r\n\r\n* Bug fixes\r\n  * Fix importPackage support in Action scripts\r\n",

    "body": "* Compatible with both Yamcs v3.4.x and v4.x\r\n* By default, Yamcs Studio wil now open in Editor mode (on a new or reset workspace)\r\n* The perspective switcher in the top-right toolbar was removed. Instead the Editor and the Runtime operate in distinct windows. Switching between the two types of windows can be done via a new button in the main toolbar.\r\n* The ‘Navigator’ tree view was replaced with an identical looking ‘Explorer’ view. This Explorer view has better default open actions. In a Runtime window, double clicking will open an OPI file in runtime mode. In an Editor window, double clicking will open an OPI file in editor mode.\r\n* Plot series max count was increased from 20 to 30.\r\n* An issue was fixed where plots with formulas would not show data when replaying past data.\r\n* The right-click “Show PV Info” popup was updated to show raw parameter values\r\n* The right-click “Show PV Info” popup will now update its content as new parameter values are incoming (note that for non-parameter PVs the data will not currently update).\r\n* The Probe popup (also available via the right-click menu of any PV widget) was refactored and now uses the MDB static alarm ranges (where applicable) to show a more meaningful meter.\r\n* Yamcs Studio will now attempt auto-reconnection when connection to Yamcs is lost.\r\n* Logging was refactored. Only INFO or worse are visible directly inside Yamcs Studio via the Console view. Debug logging (including stacktraces) are available via stdout/err.\r\n* PV autocomplete suggestions will now also include yamcs-‘local’ parameters, such as system parameters.\r\n* The event log uses different icons to be compatible with a recent change in Yamcs. The 3 old levels INFO, WARNING and ERROR are replaced by the new levels INFO, WATCH, WARNING, DISTRESS, CRITICAL and SEVERE. The ERROR state is matched to SEVERE.",
