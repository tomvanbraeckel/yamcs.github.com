**Yamcs Server**, or 'Yamcs' is the central piece of any deployment. Yamcs is responsible for acquiring, processing and dispatching data to clients via different protocols.

**Yamcs Studio** is a rich desktop client for use with Yamcs, the server. In its default configuration, it includes support for authoring and running operator displays, and comes bundled with various built-in displays that highlight different aspects of Yamcs (Alarms, Events, Commanding, Archive playbacks, etc.).
