### Launching Yamcs Studio
When you launch Yamcs Studio for the first time it will ask you to choose a workspace. A **workspace** is where you store your resources (e.g. a display file).

With Yamcs Studio, you are always working on one workspace at a time. Usually workspaces are fairly static, and you can often do with just one of them. If you untick the **Ask again?** option you will no longer see this message at startup.

![Select Workspace](/assets/studio/select-workspace.png){: .center-image }

Choose your preferred location, and click **OK**.

<p class="hint">
    If you unticked the <strong>Ask again?</strong> option, but you want to switch workspace at a later moment, open <strong>File > Switch Workspace...</strong> from the window menu to choose a different directory.
</p>


### Empty Workspace
Yamcs Studio is now launched and you should see an empty workspace with the default window arrangement:

![Empty Workspace](/assets/studio/empty-workspace.png){: .center-image }

The empty area in the middle is where displays will open.


Yamcs Studio has two different modes (called *perspectives*). OPI Editor and OPI Runtime. When Yamcs Studio is launched for the first time the user will be welcomed with the default OPI Runtime perspective, which is used during realtime operations, or for testing out displays with live telemetry.
