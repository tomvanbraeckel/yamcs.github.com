The Editor Area is a unique zone in Yamcs Studio where files are opened for editing. Typically this would be a display file (<tt>*.opi</tt>), but it doesn't have to be.

### OPI Files
OPI stands for Operator Interface, but is more commonly referred to as a *display*. OPIs are often static, but when needed can be made very dynamic by combining different widgets and PVs together using concepts like [Actions](/docs/studio/Actions), [Rules](/docs/studio/Rules) and [Scripts](/docs/studio/Scripts).

Create a new OPI file by right-clicking in the [Navigator](/docs/studio/Navigator) on the desired location, and selecting **New > OPI File**. The new file will be opened in the Editor Area.

To open an existing file, right-click it from the [Navigator](/docs/studio/Navigator) and select **Open With > OPI Editor** to open it in the Editor Area.

OPI files are created with some default properties, which includes a grid, and a size of 800x600. We will see in the section on [Properties](/docs/studio/Properties/) that we can edit these properties.

### Palette
Notice the [Palette](/docs/studio/Palette/) attached to the right of the Editor Area. The Palette contains the widgets bundled with your version of Yamcs Studio. Use the palette as your toolbox when you author a display.

To add a widget to your display, click first on its icon in the Palette, then click where you want to put it in the Editor Area.

There, an LED.

Once the widget has been placed, you can finetune its position and size using the [Properties View](/docs/studio/Properties). Some operations are also readily available in the Editor Area itself using familiar controls. Click on a widget to select it, then drag one of the handles to a different location.

You can also move a widget by pressing it, while dragging it to another location. 

To select multiple widgets, drag a box around them. To add widgets to an existing selection, hold the <tt>Ctrl</tt> key <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(&#8984; on Mac)</span> while selecting the widgets one by one. Remove a widget from the selection in similar fashion.

### Positioning Widgets
The toolbar of Yamcs Studio contains tools that help us align multiple selected widgets. For example, clicking **Align Left** repositions these three LEDs to the leftmost position.

![Align Left](/assets/studio/align-left.png){: .center-image }

There are similar tools for vertical alignments, as well as for distributing horizontal or vertical space between selected widgets.

### Match Size
We can also standardize the size of selected widgets. For example. By clicking **Match Width** and **Match Height** in sequence, we made these three LEDs the same size.

<div class="hint">
    Note that in this particular case of non-square LEDs, clicking only <strong>Match Width</strong> was actually sufficient since round LEDs can't take on the shape of an ellipse.
