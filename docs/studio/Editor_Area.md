The Editor Area is a unique zone in Yamcs Studio where files are opened for editing. Typically this would be a display file (<tt>*.opi</tt>), but it doesn't have to be.

### OPI Files
OPI stands for Operator Interface, but is more commonly referred to as a *display*. OPIs are often static, but when needed can be made very dynamic by combining different widgets and PVs together using concepts like [Actions](/docs/studio/Actions), [Rules](/docs/studio/Rules_&_Scripts/#rules) and [Scripts](/docs/studio/Rules_&_Scripts/#scripts).

In the Display Builder window, create a new OPI file, right-click in the Explorer on the desired location, and select **New > OPI File**.

![Sample OPI](/assets/studio/sample-opi.png){: .center-image }

OPI files are created with some default properties, which includes a grid, and a size of 800x600. We will see in the section on [Properties](/docs/studio/Properties/) that we can edit these properties.

### Palette
Notice the [Palette](/docs/studio/Palette/) attached to the right of the Editor Area. The Palette contains the widgets bundled with your version of Yamcs Studio. Use the palette as your toolbox when you author a display.

To add a widget to your display, click first on its icon in the Palette, then click where you want to put it in the Editor Area.

We select as example an LED.

![An LED](/assets/studio/an-led.png){: .center-image }

Once the widget has been placed, you can finetune its position and size using the [Properties View](/docs/studio/Properties). Some operations are also readily available in the Editor Area itself using familiar controls. For example, to enlarge a widget, select it, then drag its handles around with the mouse.

You can also move a widget by pressing it, while dragging it to another location. 

To select multiple widgets, drag a box around them. To add widgets to an existing selection, hold the <tt>Ctrl</tt> key <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(&#8984; on Mac)</span> while selecting the widgets one by one. Remove a widget from the selection in similar fashion.

### Positioning Widgets
The toolbar of Yamcs Studio contains tools that help us align multiple selected widgets. For example, clicking **Align Left** repositions these three LEDs to the leftmost position.

![Align Left](/assets/studio/align-left.png){: .center-image }

There are similar tools for vertical alignments, as well as for distributing horizontal or vertical space between selected widgets.

### Match Size
We can also standardize the size of selected widgets. For example. By clicking **Match Width** and **Match Height** in sequence, we made these three LEDs the same size. 
 
![Match Size](/assets/studio/match-size.png){: .center-image }

The size of the last selected widget is taken as the reference. This reference widget is highlighted with black instead of white anchor points.

<div class="hint">
    Note that in this particular case of non-square LEDs, clicking only <strong>Match Width</strong> would actually have been sufficient since round LEDs can't take on the shape of an ellipse.
