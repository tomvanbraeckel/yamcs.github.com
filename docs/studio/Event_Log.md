The Event Log view displays events from Yamcs Server. This could be on-board events, or events generated by Yamcs itself, whenever something significant occurs.

![Event Log](/assets/studio/events.png)

To load events for an earlier time range, select ![Import](/assets/studio/icons/import_wiz.gif){: .inline-image} **Import**.

Clear your view by clicking ![Import](/assets/studio/icons/clear.png){: .inline-image} **Clear**. You can always re-import events again at a later moment.

When Yamcs Studio becomes aware of a new event, it will automatically select and reveal it. You can prevent this default behaviour by toggling the ![Scroll Lock](/assets/studio/icons/lock_co.png){: .inline-image} **Scroll Lock**.

In a next iteration we plan to add features for exporting to CSV, adding a property view, and for filtering events, similar to how the current standalone [Event Viewer](/docs/tools/Event_Viewer/) tool already supports today.
