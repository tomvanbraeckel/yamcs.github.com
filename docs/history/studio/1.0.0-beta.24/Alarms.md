This view is under development, and will offer a centralised view of all active alarms, with the opportunity to acknowledge alarms or to mute any sounds. The Alarms view is not yet bundled in current copies of Yamcs Studio, but will be so in the short term.

<div class="hint">
    Currently the only way to be noticed of alarms in Yamcs Studio is by following events (if your Yamcs Server is configured to report alarm state changes as events), or by manually iterating your displays to look for widgets that have red (= major alarm) or orange (= minor alarm) colored borders around them. Our upcoming Alarms view aims to improve this process.
